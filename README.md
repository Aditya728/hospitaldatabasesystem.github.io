This repository applies structural programming and file-handling to build a simple system that adds, views, searches, and edits records in hospital’s database. I have shared both the source file and executable file of the program.

It provides with five options:

1.	Add Records: Adds any new hospital’s data into the hospital database

2.	View All Records: Allows to view all the data in the hospital database

3.	Search Records: Helps to search any specific hospital’s data in the hospital database using its Address

4.	Delete Records: Deletes the records of any hospital asking for number of beds in that hospital

5.	Exit The Program: Closes the hospital database program
